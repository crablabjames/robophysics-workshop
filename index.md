# Robophysics Workshop

This site walks you through building, controlling, and understanding a simple 3-link swimmer robot.

The idea is:
1. **Build it** – physical robot with 3 rigid links.
2. **Model it** – use geometric mechanics to predict how shape changes create motion.
3. **Test it** – run real experiments and see if the robot matches the theory.

We call that approach **robophysics**: using simple robots to answer physics / biology questions.

This is the same platform used in our Robophysics Bootcamp (Georgia Tech, July 14–16, 2025).:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## What you will eventually find on this site
**Hands-on build guide**  
How to wire the Arduino, blink an LED, control a servo, and assemble the 3-link body.

**Geometry mechanics crash intro**  
Why changing joint angles along a cycle can move the robot forward, even with no wheels.

**Experiment protocol**  
How to put the robot in a simple arena, record video with your phone, track motion, and plot displacement vs. time (TODO).

**Reading list**  
Short explanations of core robophysics papers, with PDFs and copy-paste citation blocks (TODO).
