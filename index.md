# Robophysics Workshop

This site is for:
- hands-on build tutorials (electronics, mechanics, control)
- robophysics bootcamp
- geometry mechanics 
- recommended reaidng
- links/tools if you're brand new

## What is robophysics?
Robophysics studies how locomotion emerges from interaction of body, environment, and control â€” across land, fluid, sand, clutter, etc.
